      <p>I needed to slap this together ASAP, so it kinda reminded me of when my wife and I were looking at houses years ago.  We visited one old house that was OBVIOUSLY flipped really fast for a quick sale.  There were places where the paint was still wet and even dripping.  So, welcome to my hastily slapped together website.  Sorry about the wet paint.</p>\
      <p>I built this site using <a href="https://nextjs.org" target="_blank">Next.js</a>, with hosting by <a href="https://vercel.com" target="_blank">Vercel</a>.  I have to say, Next.js/Vercel is such a wonderful development experience.  I started working with Next.js with the Mizzen+Main website, and I don\'t think I would choose anything else at this point.  It\'s just so easy.</p>\
      <p>I\'m also introducing my new branding, including my new official brand color, <code>#B00075</code> (get it?). Apparently, it\'s called "<a href="https://www.color-name.com/hex/b00075" target="_blank">Flirt</a>" &#129300;. I never would have chosen a hot pink for myself, but I think this is a case where the color chose me.  It\'s actually really grown on me.</p>',

    <p>Over the years, I'd always thought about making my own album, but never really had the inspiration to do it. In the effort to pass the time during the pandemic, I decided to \"just do it\" and start recording whatever came to mind at the moment.  The result was my new music project, <strong>The Beta Release</strong>.</p>\
    <p>I was able to get 4 songs recorded before life kicked in again, and this - an instrumental called <em>The Release</em> - is the first one that's ready to share.  The other 3 are mostly hard rock remakes of old electro-pop songs from the 80s/90s, but since I'm not really a vocalist, I'm working on bringing in someone else to handle that. Hopefully I'll be able to share those soon as well.</p>\
    <p>I hope that life will allow me to continue this project into the future.  I have a many more ideas for song remakes.  We'll see if they ever make it out of my head.</p>",

The website was designed to be a simple, clean site, to really feature the property photographs.  It featured a custom CMS built with CraftCMS, and is integrated with their MLS account to pull in their available properties.  While the MLS integration took a while to work out the kinks, we finally nailed it, and the site has performed very well for them ever since.</p>',

      '<p><strong>Hinge Analytics</strong> was a... well, I\'m not actually sure what they were.  Something about "consulting" and "results", with a ton of generic biz-speak in between.  Fortunately for me, they wanted a website that would really stand out, and Switch and I gave them one.</p>\
    <p>From the looping, fullscreen background video of a chimpanzee pounding on a computer for the homepage, to the bottom of this single-page scroller, it was nothing like what you\'d expect from a typical "analytics company".  The site was playful, top-to-bottom, which was a lot of fun for me to develop.  It also featured a custom CMS built with ExpressionEngine, so the client could update their biz-speak to their hearts desire.</p>\
    <p>OK... In all honesty, I LOVED this website, and the client was a total joy to work with, but since the company didn\'t last very long, it *might* not have been the best branding decision.  But hey, I\'m just the developer.  I leave the branding to the experts.</p>',

      "<p>The first real gigging band I was in was <strong>Interface</strong>, based in Dallas, TX.  We started in 1990 and quickly became one of the better known bands in the scene.  We later even had a song that got significant airplay on regional alt-rock stations, but weren't able to break through before things fell apart in 1994.  It's too bad...  we were pretty good.</p>\
    <p>This video was shot at the world-famous Southfork Ranch (home of the Ewings from TV's <em>Dallas</em>), where we were the headliner for the 1990 SMU homecoming celebration.  Sure... laugh all you want.  But we looked and sounded pretty fly for 1990.  This was probably the biggest crowd I'd played for at the time, so you can practically see the stage fright in my eyes.  Assuming you can peel you eyes away from my badass bolo tie and tux shirt, under the oversized blazer with rolled up sleeves.  Grrrr, baby!</p>",

      "<p>This one is interesting. A friend of mine has run a local guitar repair shop, called <strong>Dallas Guitar Repair</strong>, since the late 80s. He has a website for his business, but it was pretty old and had a lot of issues. In December of 2016, I was inspired to build him a new website and logo as a surprise Christmas gift.  I had an idea in my head, and a little extra time over the holidays, so I knocked out a quick website and sent him a link.  Obviously, this was his business, and I would make sure it represented him as he'd like, so I left the door open to make any changes that would suit him.</p>\
    <p>Well, he declined the site.  He never really said why, but just that he wasn't interested, which is totally his prerogative. So now it's just a neat little side project I made that will never get used.</p>\
    <p>It sucks for me, because I really like it, and it came together real quick.  I built it with CraftCMS, and it has a super intuitive CMS built specifically for a guitar shop.  Maybe one day I'll find a shop that could use it.  <pre>Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯</pre></p>",

    <p>It features a custom CMS, built with ExpressionEngine.  We also integrated it with their primary CRM to pull in all the data for their prospective adoptive parents.  Women could come to the site and search through the hundreds of prospective families.  Once they found families that seemed like a good fit, they could message them and start a conversation.  I was SUPER proud of this website.  We were told by Gladney that they saw a major increase in contacts once this site launched.  That\'s what I love to hear.  :)</p>',

      "<p>Back in 2006, my band at the time (Passing Strangers) had the idea to do a side project.  Our singer could kill it on U2 songs, so we thought it would be fun to start a U2 tribute band.  We called it <strong>Blood Red Sky</strong>.  The Dallas Hard Rock Cafe booked us to premiere our new band for their St Patrick's Day celebration, so we spent the couple months leading up to it practicing hard and worked up about 30 songs &mdash; many of them were already in our regular playlist.</p>\
    <p>I also built a pretty complex live video production, that would show clips from the corresponding music videos while we played the songs, along with animated graphics and transitions.  All in all, it was an awesome show.</p>\
    <p>Sadly... after months of hard work and practice, working up a really intricate show, we were SO burned out on these songs that we actually never did it again :face_palm:.  This was actually the one and only show we did with the full production.  Also, we hired someone to shoot video of the show, but they turned out to not know ANYTHING about shooting a live band.  The video he took was pretty awful, so I did the best I could and edited what I could salvage, mixed in with some still photos taken by a photographer who was there.  Even though the video doesn't really do the show justice, I think it still turned out pretty cool.</p>",
