I was the Sr Manager of Web Development for Mizzen+Main, which meant I was in charge of everything to do with the website.  I handled 90% of the front-end development for the site, and managed a team of developers for the rest. Mizzen is a Shopify store, and when I started, we were on the older Liquid platform.</p>\
      <p>In 2022, I was able to lead our team through transitioning to a more modern "headless" site, using React/Next.js and Sanity CMS, while pulling in product data through the Shopify APIs. This is a massive site, and performed extremely well as the company grew. I\'m SUPER proud of the work I was able to do at Mizzen.</p>\
      <p>Since I\'ve left, the site has gone through some significant changes, so unfortunately I can only show a video of the site from my time there.</p>',

    <p>Over the years, I'd always thought about making my own album, but never really had the inspiration to do it. In the effort to pass the time during the pandemic, I decided to \"just do it\" and start recording whatever came to mind at the moment.  The result was my new music project, <strong>The Beta Release</strong>.</p>\
    <p>I was able to get 4 songs recorded before life kicked in again, and this - an instrumental called <em>The Release</em> - is the first one that's ready to share.  The other 3 are mostly hard rock remakes of old electro-pop songs from the 80s/90s, but since I'm not really a vocalist, I'm working on bringing in someone else to handle that. Hopefully I'll be able to share those soon as well.</p>\
    <p>I hope that life will allow me to continue this project into the future.  I have a many more ideas for song remakes.  We'll see if they ever make it out of my head.</p>",

      <p>Fun fact: this is the first time I\'ve ever sung lead vocals on a song. After 40 years of playing in bands, I guess it took chicken nuggets and tater tots to give me enough inspiration to try it. <pre>¯\\_(ツ)_/¯</pre></p>',

It was a simple get-to-know-you thing for the company.</p>\
    <p>Well, the videos I had made while I was there always featured my sons (I think they\'re pretty awesome), so when it was my turn to make the "get-to-know-you" video, I kinda went a little overboard with it.  The boys and I had a nighttime video shoot at the office, with them questioning me as if they were 70s-era TV detectives interrogating a perp.  It was so much fun, and we actually knocked it out in about and hour.  Not bad for a couple rookie actors.  They totally killed it, and I couldn\'t be more proud of how this silly little video turned out. </p>\
